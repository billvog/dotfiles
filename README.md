This is my personal configuration for Fish, Neovim, Tmux and some others.

### Neovim

The Neovim configuration is written from scratch, following [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM) from [Josean Martinez](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez).

I've applied minor changes to better fit my needs.
